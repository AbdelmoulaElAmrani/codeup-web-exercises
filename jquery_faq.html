<h1>8 Facts About the Grand Canyon You Never Knew</h1>
    <DL>
        <DT><STRONG>WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW OLD IT IS</STRONG>
        <DD class="invisible">It has long been believed that the Colorado River began carving the Grand Canyon
        about 6 million years ago, but a 2012 study contained a real shocker,
        suggesting that the process may have begun as far back as 70 million years.
        In all likelihood, the Grand Canyon as we know it today started out as a series
        of smaller canyons 70 million years ago, but the majority of the canyon did not
        begin to take shape until much more recently.
        <DT><STRONG>THE GRAND CANYON CREATES ITS OWN WEATHER</STRONG>
        <DD class="invisible">Of all Grand Canyon facts, this one is pretty cool â€“ no pun intended.
        Sudden changes in elevation have an enormous impact on temperature and precipitation,
        so the weather you're experiencing could vary drastically depending on where you are in the Grand Canyon.
        The coldest, wettest weather station in the region is the Bright Angel Ranger Station on the North Rim,
        while the hottest (and one of the driest) is just 8 miles away at Phantom Ranch.
        <DT><STRONG>IT'S NOT THE DEEPEST CANYON IN THE WORLD
    </STRONG>
        <DD class="invisible">The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon in Tibet plummets to a depth of 17,567 feet,
        making it more than 2 miles deeper than the Grand Canyon's 6,093 feet.
        The Tibetan canyon is also about 30 miles longer than the Grand Canyon.
